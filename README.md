### Framing

The issue that I sought to address with my final project was that of uncomplicating the business certificate application process in the City of Cambridge. Individuals seeking to start their own business are faced with an enormous number of formalities that they must comply with when going through the business registration process, one of which is certification. The form that must be filed if one is seeking to certify their business spans four pages, contains dozens of fields, and is riddled with terms of art and acronyms that the average non-lawyer member of the general public would likely not understand. The form is extremely daunting all on its own, and that's before you even think about filing or trying to go through any of the other steps associated with business registration. So my goal was to streamline the process of filling out the business certificate application for the City of Cambridge so as to assist potential new business owners in getting their business up and running as swiftly and painlessly as posible. I targeted Cambridge specifically because of its notoriety with regards to being a hub for biomed, biotech, and pharmaceutical businesses, and because of how common it is for individuals to try and start new businesses in Cambridge. The main potential stakeholders for my interview are those individuals seeking to certify their business who might be confused or overwhelmed by the business certification application form, as well as both the State of Massachusetts and the City of Cambridge, since my interview should allow for new businesses to be more easily certified in the City of Cambridge. My main goal is to hopefully get more health-serving and publicly-benefical businesses certified and operational in Cambridge as efficiently as possible. The main two model personas of indidviduals who will be using my interview are those seeking to certify a new business and those seeking to renew an existing business certification.

### Research

As far as currently available options go, there really isn't much. Prospective new business creators have the obvious option of trying to fill out the form themselves which, as I addressed in my Framing section, is a tall order. Additionally, individuals seeking to fill out the City of Cambridge Business Certificate Application could bring the blank form to a law firm or private attorney and pay them for their time and assistance in filling out the form, but this would cost money that indidviduals in such a position might not be willing to spend. Finally, I got in touch with the City of Cambridge Clerk's Office, and they informed me that there some online form-filling assistance programs available to aid individuals in filling out their applications, but once again, these came at a price. That's really it as far as currently available options go, and as you can see, it really isn't much. That's why I hope to offer a free solution that bridges the gap between the user not having to pay to file the form and being able to receive some assistance in doing so.

### Ideation and Prototyping

In deciding which technical solution or design configuration to make use of in the creation my solution to the issue of the City of Cambridge's complicated Business Certification Application, I wanted to find an option that struck the perfect balance between ease of use, clarity, and clear direction to the user. The first idea that I considered was that of a QnA Markup interview, but I eventually decided against using it as my tool since I felt as though the UI was a bit harsh and bare, and I felt as though it would have lent itself better to a flow-chart than it would to the automation of my court form. I then considered using some type of step-by-step walkthrough using the Jupytr notebooks that we explored briefly in class, but I ultimately determined that this interface once again did not lend itself well to the automation of a court form. After the Jupytr Notebook, I explored the option of using any of the other tools that we discussed in class such as regular expressions, data scraping, or machine learning, but none of them really seemed appropriate or applicable when trying to apply them to the automation of a court form. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that a guided online interview through the DocAssemble platform would provide the best combination of the factors that I identified at the start of this section of ease of use, clarity, and clear direction to the user. This led to my running the Business Certificate Application through Documate to assign names and variables to the many fields on my form, before giving it a pass through the AssemblyLine Weaver, and eventually coming out with a very rough outline of a guided online interview for the form.
